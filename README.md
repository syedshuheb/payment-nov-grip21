# TASK : ADDING PAYMENT GATEWAY TO A WEBSITE
* I have added payment gateway using Razorpay
* Supports payments via credit/debit card , UPI , wallet , netbanking, etc.
* The payment gateway also sends an email to the recipient's email-id
* It also allows to share and spread the news about the website via tweetables.

# To run the code
* Clone the repository / download the zip files
* Change the file locations accordingly & replace the razorpay payment button key with your own key.
